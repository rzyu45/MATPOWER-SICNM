# MATPOWER-SICNM

 This repo is an extension package for the algorithms of Matpower, includeing:

 1. Our proposed semi-implicit continuous Newton method (SICNM).
 2. The classic Iwamoto's robust method;
 3. The original Continuous Newton method proposed by Federico Milano.
 4. Other algorithms used for comparison in our paper.

 This repo also holds the source codes of our paper currently under peer review.

## Usage 

Please add the `src` folder to your matlab path. Use the `runpfa()` function to run the cases in `cases` folder.
